## Tech Stack

This search experience is powered by <a href="https://typesense.org" target="_blank">Typesense</a> which is
a blazing-fast, <a href="https://github.com/typesense/typesense" target="_blank">open source</a> typo-tolerant
search-engine. It is an open source alternative to Algolia and an easier-to-use alternative to ElasticSearch.

The songs dataset is from <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/" target="_blank">MusicBrainz</a> which is an open
music encyclopedia that collects music metadata and makes it available to the public. Please contribute to it if you're able to!

The app was built using the <a href="https://github.com/typesense/typesense-instantsearch-adapter" target="_blank">
Typesense Adapter for InstantSearch.js</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean's App Platform</a>.

The search backend is powered by a geo-distributed 3-node Typesense cluster running on <a href="https://cloud.typesense.org" target="_blank">Typesense Cloud</a>,
with nodes in Oregon, Frankfurt and Mumbai.
